# Arknights Recruitment Simulator
A replica of [Aceship's Recruitment Calculator](https://aceship.github.io/AN-EN-Tags/akhr.html) with additional functions, including photo recognition for faster uploads, recommendation of tags for the maximum value, and recruitment simulations.

## Why use this over Aceship?
To be completely frank, there is not much of a difference between the two, as this was made to be a replica of Aceship's web application.
However, we do provide additional services that engage in image recognition that allow the user to upload a screenshot or image of your tags and provide a thorough investigation of the best tags to take for maximum value.
To aid our case more, we used
[Gamepress' recruitment research](https://gamepress.gg/arknights/database/arknights-recruitment-tag-appearance-and-rarity-rate-statistic)
to build a simulation for users to try out for fun, just to see the chances of getting certain tags and their drop rates.

In all honesty, I built this for use just so I do not need to memorize specific combos or manually input the options into Aceship's application.

Please enjoy using this, if you do use it!

## How to run locally
